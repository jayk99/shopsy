Key Concepts:

Responsive Design :

Shopsy is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices of all sizes. This is achieved using Tailwind CSS, which provides a utility-first approach to styling.

Component-Based Architecture :

Built with React, Shopsy leverages a component-based architecture to promote reusability and maintainability. Each section of the store, such as the Navbar, Hero section, and Product listings, is encapsulated in its own component.

Animations and Transitions :

Shopsy utilizes the AOS (Animate on Scroll) library to enhance the user experience with smooth animations and transitions as users scroll through the site.

Dark Mode Support :

The store includes a dark mode feature, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes seamlessly. This is implemented using localStorage to remember the user's theme preference.
